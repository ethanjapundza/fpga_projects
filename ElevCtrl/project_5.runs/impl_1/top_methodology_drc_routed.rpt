2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell evc0/segments_reg[6]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) SSD0/segments_reg[6]/CLR, SSD0/segments_reg[5]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin evc0/FSM_sequential_state_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin evc0/FSM_sequential_state_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin evc0/FSM_sequential_state_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch SSD0/segments_reg[5] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin SSD0/segments_reg[5]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch SSD0/segments_reg[6] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin SSD0/segments_reg[6]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
